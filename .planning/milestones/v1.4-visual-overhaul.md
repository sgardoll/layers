# v1.4 Visual Overhaul

**Milestone Goal:** Transform the generic aesthetic into a distinctive, clean, light, and airy design system while fixing the mobile portrait UX issue.

**Target:** v1.4.0

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Typography: Distinctive, readable fonts that feel designed (not system defaults)
- [ ] Color: Refined, intentional palette with proper hierarchy
- [ ] Spacing: Generous whitespace, better information architecture
- [ ] Mobile UX: Right column no longer blocks 3D visualizer in portrait mode
- [ ] Components: Buttons, inputs, cards feel refined and cohesive
- [ ] Premium feel: App feels like a high-end creative tool

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Complete design system (typography, colors, spacing)
- All screen visual polish (auth, project, export, settings)
- Mobile portrait layout fix for 3D viewer
- Component refinements

**Out of Scope:**
- New features (functionality stays the same)
- Changes to 3D viewer internals (visual polish only)
- Architecture changes
- Complex animation overhauls

## Design Direction

**Aesthetic:** Clean, light, airy with generous whitespace
**Reference:** Refined minimalism — like a pro creative tool
**Key Constraint:** 3D Layer Space View stays functionally unchanged, but must work with improved mobile layout

## Phases

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 18 | Design System Foundation | Not Started |
| 19 | Mobile UX & Layout | Not Started |
| 20 | Screen Polish | Not Started |
