# Milestone v1.2: Critical Bug Fixes

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-26
**Version:** v1.1.2 build 14
**Phases:** 15

## Overview

Emergency bug fix release addressing critical issues discovered in production testing after v1.1 launch.

## Issues Fixed

1. **iOS image picker not creating projects**
   - Root cause: iOS sandboxing prevents `File(path).readAsBytes()`
   - Fix: Use `XFile.readAsBytes()` directly from image_picker
   - Files: `lib/screens/project_screen.dart`, `lib/services/supabase_project_service.dart`, `lib/providers/project_provider.dart`

2. **Image thumbnails not showing**
   - Root cause: `getPublicUrl()` requires public bucket; our bucket is private
   - Fix: Use `createSignedUrl()` for 1-hour signed URLs
   - Files: `lib/screens/project_screen.dart`

3. **RevenueCat subscription options not displaying**
   - Root cause: `main.dart` initialized RevenueCat but provider created separate uninitialized instance
   - Fix: Pass initialized instance to ProviderScope via override
   - Files: `lib/main.dart`, deleted `lib/providers/revenuecat_provider.dart`

4. **Status badge overflow**
   - Root cause: Row with `mainAxisSize: min` overflowing narrow containers
   - Fix: Wrap Text in Flexible with ellipsis overflow
   - Files: `lib/screens/project_screen.dart`

5. **Export compliance prompt**
   - Added `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = false` to skip App Store questionnaire
   - Files: `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

## Deployment

| Platform | Version | Build | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| iOS | 1.1.2 | 14 | TestFlight |
| Android | 1.1.2 | 14 | Play Store Internal |
| macOS | 1.1.2 | 13 | App Store Connect |

## Key Decisions

- Use signed URLs instead of public URLs for Supabase storage (works with private buckets)
- Pass service instances via ProviderScope overrides when initialization is async
