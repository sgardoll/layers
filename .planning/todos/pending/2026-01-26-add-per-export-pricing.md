## Problem

Currently the app likely has subscription-only or one-time purchase pricing. Users should be able to pay USD $0.50 per export as a low-commitment option to use the product without subscribing.

This requires:
1. App UI changes to offer per-export purchase option
2. App Store Connect / Play Console IAP setup for consumable purchase
3. RevenueCat configuration for the new product

## Solution

TBD - needs RevenueCat consumable product setup, store listings, and UI flow for purchase-before-export
