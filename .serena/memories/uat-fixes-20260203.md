# UAT Fixes Applied - 2026-02-03

## Issues Fixed

### UAT-001: 3D Viewer Layer Ordering
**Problem:** Layer images rendered in wrong order (Layer 1 behind Layer 3)
**Fix:** 
- Changed sorting to descending zIndex
- Reversed iteration order so front layers paint last
- Reduced hidden layer overlay opacity from 0.7 → 0.4

### UAT-002: Android Download Link Failure

**Fix:**
- Removed `canLaunchUrl()` check
- Added try-catch error handling
- Implemented fallback to `LaunchMode.platformDefault`

### UAT-003: Android "Manage" Button
**Problem:** Hardcoded to iOS App Store URL
**Fix:**
- Added platform detection with switch expression
- Android now opens Google Play Store subscriptions
- iOS/macOS still opens Apple App Store
